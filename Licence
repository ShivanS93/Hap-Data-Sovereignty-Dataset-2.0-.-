The following license was originally written by Te Hiku Media and has been modified by Karaitiana Taiuru to allow for and recognise Hapū Sovereignty of their own data. 

Preamble:
Kaitiaki is a Māori word without specific English translation, but its meaning are similar to the words guardian, protector, and custodian. In this context we protect the hapū
and Iwi names in this repository and will provide access to the data set as we deem fit through our tikanga (Māori customs and protocols).

While we recognize the importance of open source technology, we're mindful that the majority of tangata whenua and other Indigenous Peoples may not have access to the resources
that enable them to benefit from open source technologies. As tangata whenua, our ability to grow, develop, and innovate has been stymied through colonisation.

We must protect our ability to grow as tangata whenua. By simply open sourcing our data and knowledge, we further allow ourselves to be colonised digitally in the modern world.

The Hapū Kaitiakitanga License is a work in progress. It's a living license. It will evolve as we see fit. This is a license that is an international example for Indigenous People's retention of mana over data and other intellectual property in a Western construct.

Kaitiakitanga of Content:
The kaitiakitanga of all data in the Hapū Data Set remains with the respective hapū.
